## Demographic Table {.tabset}

The table below provides the details of the demographic composition of all schools in the school districts in the Piedmont Region/Blue Ridge Health District:

* Albemarle County Public Schools
* Augusta County Public Schools
* Buckingham County Public Schools
* Charlottesville City Schools
* Fluvanna County Public Schools
* Greene County Public Schools
* Louisa County Public Schools
* Nelson County Public Schools
* Staunton City Schools 
* Waynesboro City Schools

According to **Virginia Department of Education (VDOE)** documentation:

* Race or Ethnicity captures "the racial category that most closely reflects the studentâ€™s recognition of his or her community or with which the student identifies"

* Economic status "identifies students as economically disadvantaged if they meet any one of the following: 1) is eligible for Free/Reduced Meals, or 2) receives TANF, or 3) is eligible for Medicaid, or 4) identified as either Migrant or experiencing Homelessness."

Scroll further right to see the percent of a school's student body by race and the number and percent of students identified as economically disadvantaged. The tables can be sorted by any column by clicking on the up/down arrow next to the column name.

These numbers reflect Fall Membership numbers provided by the Virginia Department of Education's Fall Membership Build-a-Table site (https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex_captcha/home.do?apexTypeId=304).
